### Command for creating a new zip archive file

zip ../version2python.zip -r * .[^.]*

### Summary:
This creates a ZIP file named version2python.zip in the parent directory, including:

All files and subdirectories (recursively) in the current directory.
Hidden files and folders (e.g., .git, .env), except for . (current directory) and .. (parent directory).
The -r ensures everything is included, making it ideal for archiving the entire project folder with all configurations and hidden files.
